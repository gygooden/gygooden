### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Grayson, and I'm a junior at Wake Forest University. I'm interested in all things Python and machine learning!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designing neural networks for medical research in a computer science lab and developing software for an early stage biotechnology startup!
- ðŸŒ± I recently built a program for a hackathon that optimizes personal medical diagnoses and helps users track their health! Still working on expanding here: [https://github.com/gygooden/WakeHackathon]
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creative real-world projects!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am preparing for competitive powerlifting competitions!
