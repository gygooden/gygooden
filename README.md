### Hi 👋

#### My name is Grayson, and I'm a senior at Wake Forest University pursuing a B.S. in CompSci. I'm interested in all things biotech, fintech, & machine learning!

- 🔬 I am currently working on an honors thesis @ Wake Forest University in the AI & Computational Biology Lab, focusing on interpretable insights for Alzheimer's disease. Please take a look here: [(https://chenm19.github.io/projects/ad-explorer/)]
- 🔭 I was most recently a SWE Intern @ Vestmark, designing financial technologies + designing neural networks for medical research in a computer science lab + developing software for an early-stage biotechnology startup!
- 🌱 My most recent personal project is a full-stack web app that assists users in tracking their daily habits and estimating their carbon impact. It uses fuzzy logic to recognize activities, calculates CO₂ savings (or emissions), and offers motivating, personalized eco tips! Currently built with React, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL: [(https://github.com/gygooden/GreenPrint)]
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creative real-world projects!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am training to compete in powerlifting!
