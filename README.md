### Hi ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Grayson, and I'm a senior at Wake Forest University studying CS & Mathematics. I'm interested in all things fintech & machine learning!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a SWE Intern @ Vestmark designing financial technologes + designing neural networks for medical research in a computer science lab + developing software for an early-stage biotechnology startup!
- ðŸŒ± My most recent project is a full-stack web app that assists users in tracking their daily habits and estimating their carbon impact. It uses fuzzy logic to recognize activities, calculates COâ‚‚ savings (or emissions), and offers motivating, personalized eco tips! Currently built with React, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL: [(https://github.com/gygooden/GreenPrint)]
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creative real-world projects!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am training to compete in powerlifting!
